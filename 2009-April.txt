Subject: [privacy-users] Fluido project, a new way of sharing contents
Message-ID: <20090414104003.GA6527@discovery>

http://code.autistici.org/trac/fluido

Hi all,

 I'd just like to submit the above link to let you know about the Fluido
project. From its home page:

"A vision on future of p2p A new file sharing platform. It's innovative
not because of the way of sharing files (it's based on Bittorrent), but
because the way it's tought: instead of a list where users search for
what they need, Fluido organizes contents in themed groups (shares).
Sharing a file with a group, all members of the group receive relevant
meta-information and can decide to download it. A group can be public,
private or moderated (a restricted number of people has write access to
the group, everybody else just read access). Ehy, this is also free
software, we distribuite it under GPLv3 license."

 I already know that the available codebase is different by now (Fluido
is written in Python and relies on BitTorrent); but I do believe that a
little collaboration could be very positive for both projects.

Best regards!
Marco
